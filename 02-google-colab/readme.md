### Setting Up Your Colab Environment for Learning

Follow these steps to prepare and utilize Google Colab effectively:

#### Step 1: Open Google Colab
- Navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
- Sign in with your Google account and create a new notebook.

#### Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Colab comes pre-installed with many libraries, but you may need additional tools for advanced AI tasks. Use the following commands to install them:

```python
# Update existing libraries
!pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

# Install additional libraries
!pip install torch torchvision torchaudio  # For PyTorch
!pip install tensorflow                   # For TensorFlow
!pip install transformers                 # Hugging Face Transformers for NLP
!pip install langchain langgraph          # For Agentic AI workflows
!pip install openai                       # OpenAI API for GPT-based agents
!pip install matplotlib seaborn           # For data visualization
```

#### Step 3: Access GPU/TPU Resources
- Navigate to `Runtime > Change runtime type` in the Colab menu.
- Select **GPU** or **TPU** under the "Hardware accelerator" option.

#### Step 4: Explore AI Libraries
Start by experimenting with pre-built examples and workflows. For instance:

**Example: Load a Pre-trained NLP Model**
```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a pre-trained sentiment analysis pipeline
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# Analyze sentiment
result = sentiment_analyzer("I love learning Modern AI Python and Agentic AI!")
print(result)
```

**Example: Interact with OpenAI's GPT Models**
```python
import openai

# Set up API key
openai.api_key = "your-api-key"

# Generate a response using GPT
response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="text-davinci-003",
    prompt="Explain the concept of Agentic AI in simple terms.",
    max_tokens=100
)

print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
```

#### Step 5: Work Collaboratively
- Share your Colab notebook via the "Share" button to collaborate with others in real-time.
