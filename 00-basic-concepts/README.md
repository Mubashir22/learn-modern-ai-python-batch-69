## Essential Development Tools

To build and deploy AI applications effectively, we'll cover the following tools:

### Linux Basics

- **What is Linux?**: An open-source operating system widely used in servers and development environments.
- **Command-Line Proficiency**: Navigating and managing files using the terminal.

### Docker

- **What is Docker?**: A platform to develop, ship, and run applications in containers.
- **Why Docker?**: Ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
- **Getting Started with Containers**: Building and running your first Docker container.

### Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and DevContainers

- **VSCode Overview**: A powerful, extensible code editor.
- **DevContainers**: Using Docker containers as development environments within VSCode for consistent setups.

### GitHub

- **Version Control with Git**: Tracking changes and collaborating on code.
- **GitHub Repositories**: Hosting and sharing your projects.
- **Collaboration Workflows**: Pull requests, issues, and project management.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment


<!--  -->


Before we dive into coding, it's essential to have a properly configured environment.  

- **Installing Python 3.x**: Ensure you set up the latest version of Python to take advantage of the newest features and improvements.  
- **Setting Up VSCode**: Install Visual Studio Code and add essential extensions like the Python extension, Pylance, and Jupyter for an optimized Python development experience.
- **Google Colab for Python Practice**: While configuring the local environment is crucial, we will extensively use Google Colab for running and practicing Python code. Google Colab provides an accessible, cloud-based environment with pre-installed libraries, GPUs, and seamless collaboration, making it an excellent choice for experimenting with Python code."  
- **Docker Installation**: Get Docker up and running on your system to facilitate containerized development, ensuring a consistent environment across all machines.  
Docker uses Linux OS because it relies on Linux kernel features such as cgroups (control groups) for resource isolation and namespaces for containerization. These kernel-level features enable lightweight, efficient(CPU, memory, etc.), and secure isolation of applications, making Linux an ideal choice for Docker's container runtime.
- **Creating a DevContainer**: Set up a containerized development environment for isolated and reproducible workflows, enhancing collaboration in team projects.
